## Summary
The completed analysis of the Citi Bike data from New York City proved to be successful. The data visualizations from August reveals that a well implemented Citi Bike program could prove to be beneficial to the citizens of Des Moines and profitable to investors. 
Additional visualizations that are recommended for the future are the following:
-	Analyze the customers versus the subscribers for the year by gender.
